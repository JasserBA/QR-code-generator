# QR-code-generator
# QR Code Generator Readme

This is a simple QR code generator built using HTML, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5. The application allows users to create QR codes for URLs or text. The QR code is generated using the [qrserver.com](https://qrserver.com) API. Below is a brief explanation of the code and how to use the generator.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. Enter the desired text or URL in the input field.

4. Click the "Generate QR Code" button to create the QR code.

5. The QR code will be displayed below the input field.

6. If you change the input text or clear the input field, the QR code will be hidden.

## Files

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the QR code generator.
- `css/bootstrap.min.css`: Bootstrap 5 CSS file for styling the components.
- `css/style.css`: Custom CSS file to add additional styles to the application.
- `js/bootstrap.min.js`: Bootstrap 5 JavaScript file for enhancing the components.
- `js/index.js`: Custom JavaScript file containing the logic for generating and displaying the QR code.

## Code Explanation

The JavaScript code contains event listeners to handle the generation and display of the QR code.

- `generatorBtn.addEventListener`: This event listener listens for clicks on the "Generate QR Code" button. When the button is clicked, the input value is extracted and used to generate the QR code image using the qrserver.com API. The generated QR code is displayed below the input field.

- `qrInput.addEventListener`: This event listener listens for any changes in the input field. If the input field is empty, the QR code container will be hidden.

## Dependencies

The generator uses Bootstrap 5 and the [qrserver.com](https://qrserver.com) API to create and display the QR code. Make sure you have an internet connection to fetch the QR code image.
